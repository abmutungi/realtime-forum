### Real Time Forum

This repository contains files from a project completed at 01 Founders Coding School.

This project is an upgrade on previous forum. We designed a football forum which focussed on the following points:

- Registration and Login
- Creation of posts
- Commenting posts
- Private Messages

The forum uses the following technologies:

- SQLite, in which we stored data
- Golang, in which we handled data and Websockets (Backend)
- Javascript, in which we handled all the Frontend events and clients Websockets
- HTML, in which we organised the elements of the page
- CSS, in which we styled the elements of the page

This project introduced me to :

- The basics of web :
  - HTML
  - HTTP
  - Sessions and cookies
  - CSS
  - Backend and Frontend
  - DOM
- Go routines
- Go channels
- WebSockets:
  - Go Websockets
  - JS Websockets
- SQL language
  - Manipulation of databases
